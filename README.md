# Intro
Simple Point of Sale (POS) system based on Django. Not for production yet !

# Todos
Lot of things need to be polished up. This originally developed for very
specific client so parts need to be generalized further. Things that I'd
like to pursue:-

* Custom `Customer` model so specific customer data can be put here.
* PDF generation for invoice, receipt and report. Currently pretty rudimentary.
* Upgrade to Django 1.7. This was developed while 1.4 still hot and then left
  dormant in my repository.
* Proper l10n. Currently the main interface is in Malay.
* Add tests !
